		<p>Data from GPS-enabled vehicles has become more and more widely used by travel-behavior researchers 
		and transportation system modelers. However as the GPS data has measurement and sampling errors  it 
		becomes a non-trivial task to infer a map feature associated with a sequence of GPS measurements, 
		especially as maps features may also have inaccuracies. The task of assigning a set of GPS points to 
		a set of map features is called the map matching problem, and the requirement for the assigned features
		to form a consistent travel route adds additional complexity. The majority of the existing algorithms 
		concentrate on scenarios when sampling rate is low and/or measurement error is high. However, as GPS 
		devices become more accurate and sampling rate becomes higher, a new issue arises, the issue of efficiently
		of analyzing large scale high frequency GPS data sets.  This software allows for the analysis of high-accuracy and 
		high-frequency GPS data sets using a modified version of the Multiple Hypothesis Technique to match network links,
		with accuracy and computational efficiency being the focus. The software is implemented in Python using the Spatialite
		library for GIS functionality, and works with the POLARIS database format. The software builds on existing work in several ways:
		<ul>
		<li>(i) Speed-up step that significantly reduces the number of candidate paths</li>
		<li>(ii) Improved the way GPS trace segments are matched to road network at turns and intersections</li>
		<li>(iii) Added new filtering step to identify U-Turn movements
		<li>(iv)We demonstrate the process of manually fitting the parameters of the algorithm
		</ul>
